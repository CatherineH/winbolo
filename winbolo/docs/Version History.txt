* By popular demand Bolo like starts allocation are now implemented. WinBolo
  trys to avoid starting you near tanks and enemy pillboxes. From the Bolo
  Version History document: "Improved start position allocation for maps with
  very few start squares defined, to cope better with certain "creative" map
  designs. For example, if you have a map with only two start squares, and
  you have a game of two teams where each team has a pillbox close to one of
  the start squares, then each team will effectively have their own 'private'
  start square, because with only two start squares to choose from when
  bringing a new tank into the game, Bolo will choose the one near the
  friendly pillbox, not the one near the hostile pillbox."
* Fixed tank label clipping problem.
* WinBolo now uses the TERRAIN_UNKNOWN terrain until the tank first encounters
  the map location. This is in accordance to the Bolo brain standard.

  is non  capturable a value of 1 is passed.

* Reports corrupt packets.
* Removed pill building sound echoes on laggy connections.
* Servers now send out their addresses to the tracker. If the server 
  address field of the info packet received is 0 (0.0.0.0) it is from 
  the server, not a client so the IP that the packet arrived from can
  be used to contact determine the server address.

Interface:
* Changed graphics to appear more Bolo like. Thanks to Canuck for

* 'By popular request, there is now an "Auto Slowdown" option 
   which makes the tank automatically decelerate as soon as you 
   release the "Go" button. Before you use this though, let me 
   warn you: The result is that you hold the "Go" button down to 
   go full speed, and let go to stop, making it almost impossible 
   to drive at any speed in between.' (From Bolo Version History
   0.97) The auto show/hide gunsights also been added. This 
   addition however causes your preferences file to be recreated 
   so the first time you run WinBolo 1.01 you will be informed 
   your preferences file is corrupt and the values will be 
   reinitiated. Sorry.
* Send Messages window now sets the focus to the text box so you can
  start typing straight away. It sets the focus back to the main 
  window when closed.

  sound. (Having no sound card causes it to fail)
