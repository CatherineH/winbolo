WOME - WinBolo Online Map Editor


WOME was a 1 day hack. It is a stateless WinBolo map editor written as a CGI Scipt

To build type make.

You will want to edit the BASE_URL define in main.c as well as in the HTML files and other locations.


Makes use of:

* cgihtml CGI framework (v1.69) by Eric Kim (http://www.eekim.com/software/cgihtml/)
* base64 encoding/decoding example functions from the public domain.
