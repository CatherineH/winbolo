This directory contains the brains template source code and the VFWSpeilborg Brain. VFWSpeilborg was a copy of the speilborg brain from bolo. It is obsolete now due to built in log recording. It does provide an example on how to process keyboard commands in a brain file.

Both should be compiled as windows DLL's then renamed to .brn files and placed in the brain WinBolo subdirectory to work.
