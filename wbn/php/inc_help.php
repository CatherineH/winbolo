<B>What is Bolo?</B><BR>
Bolo was created by Stuart Cheshire of Stanford University. It has evolved from a little-known tank game on the BBC Micro to an explosively successful Macintosh game that is played constantly on the Internet, as well as many smaller networks. The author summarizes his work: 

"Bolo is a 16 player graphical networked real-time multi-player tank battle game. It has elements of arcade-style shoot-em-up action, but for the serious players who play 12 hour games with 16 players working in teams in different networked computer clusters around an office or university campus, it becomes more of a strategy game. You have to play it to understand." (from <a href="http://www.lgm.com/bolo/intro/">OBHP Intro</A>)<P>

<B>How much does it cost?</B><BR>
WinBolo.net is completely free. There are no signup fees, no ongoing monthly fees, no per game fees. However, the game WinBolo is not free. It is released as shareware. "The price of WinBolo is $25 in US Dollars. You have the opportunity to actually play the game before you decide whether it is worth the price I ask. WinBolo has no copy protection, no expiry date, no network serial number registration, and no disabled features which you cannot use until you pay. My attitude is that some people are honest, and some people are not. The dishonest ones will never pay anyway, so all the software protection just inconveniences the honest people." For more information please see the <A href="shareware.php">WinBolo Shareware Information</A>.

<B>How does ranking work?</B><BR>
Games are ranked using a modified version of the ELO algorithm. The ELO algorithm is used by Chess players and by the original Internet Bolo League. The algorithm can be summed at by:
<ul>
<li>When player signs up they receive an initial score of 1600</li>
<li>When a game is played the two scores are feed into the algorithm and the winners score is increased and the losers decreased.</li>
<li>The algorithm takes into an account the relative scores of the two players. For instance if a player with a high score (i.e a good player) beats a player with a low score (a not so good player) the winner will only receive a few points and the loser will only lose a couple of points. However if a low ranked player beats a high ranked player they will gain a lot of points.</li>
</ul>

<B>Why didn't my 1x1 get ranked?</B><BR>
As Winbolo.net is an automated ranking system and does not rely on any human game reporting certain conditions must be met for the game to be considered a valid 1x1 game. The criteria for a game to be ranked is:
<ul>
<li>One player must have captured and own all bases.</li>
<li>No non-participants can have captured any bases or pillboxes.</li>
<li>Only 2 players have played and captured any bases or pillboxes.</li>
<li>Both players must of captured at least one base or pillbox.</li>
</ul>

<B>Why didn't my team get ranked?</B><BR>
As Winbolo.net is an automated ranking system and does not rely on any human game reporting certain conditions must be met for the game to be considered a valid team game. The criteria for a game to be ranked is:
<ul>
<li>One team must have captured and own all bases.</li>
<li>No non-participants can have captured any bases or pillboxes.</li>
<li>All team members on both sides must be allied at the end of the game.</li>
<li>At least one base or pillbox must be captured by two members of both teams.</li>
</ul><p>

<B>Why does the number of games played not match the number of wins plus loses?</B><BR>
Winbolo.net will update the number of games played for every game you join and leave regardless of whether you do anything in the game at all. Winbolo.net will only update the number of wins/loses if a ranking game is played. So this number will more then likely be smaller then the number of games played. Also Winbolo.net will update the number of bases/pills/tanks for every game you play in.<p>
