<B> Registering</B><P>
NOTE: This file is largely based upon the Bolo readme.shareware file as WinBolo shareware scheme is similar to Bolo.  The terms WinBolo and LinBolo can be freely interchanged as the shareware scheme is the same for both. If you register LinBolo you are free to use WinBolo. If you register WinBolo you are free to use LinBolo. I.e you only have to register once.<P>

The price of WinBolo is $25 in US Dollars. You have the opportunity to actually play the game before you decide whether it is worth the price I ask. WinBolo has no copy protection, no expiry date, no network serial number registration, and no disabled features which you cannot use until you pay. My attitude is that some people are honest, and some people are not. The dishonest ones will never pay anyway, so all the software protection just inconveniences the honest people.
<P>
If you want to show WinBolo to a group of 10 friends who have not seen it, they are not required to buy their own copies before they can play, as they would if WinBolo were like most commercial software. However, if YOU are a regular WinBolo player, and you wish to see WinBolo continue to be improved, then please pay your shareware fee. Knowing someone else who has paid does not count as "having paid your shareware fee." The company Kagi handles registration of WinBolo. You may register in one of the two following ways:
<P>
<OL><LI>Visit <A href="https://order.kagi.com/?XYV" target="_new">https://order.kagi.com/?XYV</A> which allows credit card orders to be placed via the internet.</LI>
<LI>Run the "Register.exe" application located in the WinBolo directory. (Windoes only) Follow the instructions to register by credit card or cheque/money order.</LI>
</OL><P>
If you can't afford anything at all then obviously I'd rather you played WinBolo than not, so send me a post card instead. Contact me via my web email form for address details. Ultimately, it's down to your own conscience to decide.<P>

If you are a school teacher who wants to register for a WinBolo 'site license', please be considerate to my time. I don't have a marketing department to negotiate prices and conditions based on the number of computers you have, how old the students are, etc. This is shareware. YOU decide what a fair price is. A lot of school teachers have collected $5 each from the students who want to play, which I approve of -- too many children grow up thinking that the only way to get software is to steal it because it is so expensive that they could never afford to buy it legally. I'm glad to be able to offer them a game they enjoy at a price they can afford.<P>

Kagi automatically replies with a confirmation email if you include your email address when registering. For a written acknowledgment of your payment Kagi charges an additional $1 to cover posting costs.<P>

(Notification however is) When notifying please include all relevant details.<P>
